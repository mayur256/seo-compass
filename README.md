## 2. In-Scope Features (MVP)

This section defines the core features the development team will build for the initial release (V1).

### 2.1. System Architecture & Submission

| Feature | Technical Description (For Engineers) | Stakeholder Interpretation (For Business) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **URL Submission Interface** | A responsive front-end form that posts a URL string to the backend's `/analyze` API endpoint. | A simple, clear input box where the user starts the process. |
| **Asynchronous Processing** | Implementation of a **Python web framework (Flask/Django)** paired with a **Task Queue (Celery/Redis)** to offload long-running analysis jobs to background workers. | The system won't freeze or crash while waiting for the complex analysis to finish; it will run in the background. |
| **Results Persistence** | Use of a **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** database to store all analysis data and generated content files permanently. | All reports are saved securely and can be retrieved by the user at any time. |

### 2.2. Core Analysis Pipeline

| Feature | Technical Description (For Engineers) | Stakeholder Interpretation (For Business) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Competitor Discovery** | Integration with a **SERP API** (e.g., Semrush, SerpApi) to perform automated searches based on the input URL's primary topic and extract the top 10 organic results. | The system finds and identifies the **top 5-10 direct competitors** ranking on Google for the user's niche. |
| **Primary Keyword Extraction** | Scripts will analyze the input URL's meta tags, title, and body copy to identify and report on 10 relevant, high-traffic keywords for the niche. | We learn exactly what terms are driving traffic in the user's market and what to target. |

### 2.3. Output and Reporting

| Feature | Technical Description (For Engineers) | Stakeholder Interpretation (For Business) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LLM-Based Content Drafts** | Integration with a **Large Language Model (LLM) API** (e.g., GPT-4) to generate initial, structured drafts for three predetermined pages (e.g., Home, Services, About Us) based on the discovered keywords. | The AI automatically writes **human-like content drafts** for the most important pages of the user's website. |
| **Report Dashboard** | A dedicated page that retrieves and formats the stored analysis data, presenting it in an easily digestible format (tables and lists). | A simple, clean results page where users can view all the competitive data and content drafts. |
| **Report Download** | A function to package all generated data and content into a single downloadable file (e.g., **CSV** for data and **PDF/TXT** for content). | A one-click option to get all the data and drafts for sharing and offline use. |
